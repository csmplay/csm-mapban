Fair Use and Third-Party Intellectual Property Notice

This open-source software project ("the Project") makes use of certain names, trademarks, logos, icons, and map icons that are the exclusive property of the following third-party rights holders:

Splatoon 3 — Nintendo Co., Ltd.
Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) — Valve Corporation
Valorant — Riot Games, Inc.

The Project is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by Nintendo, Valve, or Riot Games in any way. All rights, titles, and interests in and to the aforementioned trademarks and copyrighted materials remain solely with their respective owners.

Use of these third-party intellectual properties within the Project is limited to what is necessary to enable the Project’s transformative functions, including but not limited to map veto, map pick, and coordination tools, which provide new utility and do not replicate or replace any original game content or functionality.

The Project’s usage of such assets is made in reliance upon the fair use doctrine codified in Section 107 of the United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 107), specifically emphasizing the transformative nature of the Project’s purpose and character. The Project adds new meaning and context by offering tools that assist competitive gameplay and streaming, rather than substituting the original games or their markets.

Where feasible, the Project modifies, stylizes, or abstracts third-party assets to further distinguish them from the original materials and to ensure they serve a clearly transformative role.

No part of the Project includes or distributes full copies, substantial portions, or core content of the original games, nor does it incorporate assets in a manner that would impair the market value of the original works.

If you are a rights holder and believe that any aspect of this Project infringes your intellectual property rights, please contact us at the following address so that we may address your concerns in good faith:
